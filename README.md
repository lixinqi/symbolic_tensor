# Experience

A **self-improving harness framework** built as a PyTorch extension. Composable tensor ops + trainable experience + autograd = portable Modules that improve through training.

The result: **portable, self-improving agents** that share the same infrastructure but learn different skills through training. Like Claude Code slash commands, but standardized — typed tensors, autograd, shape contracts, trainable experience.

## Example: LLM Coder Simulator

An LLM-powered coder composed entirely from reusable ops — no custom logic except a termination validator. Two chained experts collaborate: Expert 1 decides WHAT to do, Expert 2 knows HOW to do it.

```
# [1, 30] live terminal text
capture_op       = ft_tmux_capture_pane(workspace)
# [1, 30] → "text:hint"|"ctrl:hint"
decision_expert  = ft_expert(capture_op, decision_exp)
# [1, 30] → "echo hello"|"Enter"
cmd_expert       = ft_expert(decision_expert, cmd_exp)
# [1, 30] routes by prefix
switched_send    = ft_switch(decision_expert, [("text",…),("ctrl",…)])
# [1, 30]
validator        = ft_coder_validator(ft_sequential(switched_send, sleep, capture))
# [1] reduced
output           = ft_recurrent(validator)
```

Every op except `ft_coder_validator` is shared infrastructure reusable across all harness models.

### Chain Experts, Don't Parse

Instead of one monolithic expert + custom parsers:

```python
# BAD: custom parsing, not reusable, not trainable
decision = parse_action(expert_output)  # brittle regex
cmd = extract_command(expert_output)    # another custom parser
```

Chain two experts — each with its own trainable experience:

```python
# GOOD: composable, trainable, extensible
decision_expert = ft_expert(capture_op, decision_experience, topk=2)   # WHAT
cmd_expert = ft_expert(decision_expert, cmd_experience, topk=2)         # HOW
```

Expert 1's output feeds directly as Expert 2's input. New action types don't require changing Expert 2 — just add experience entries to Expert 1.

### Experience Tensors (Learnable Weights)

```python
# Decision expert: terminal observation → action_type:hint
decision_experience = make_tensor([
    ["提示符后面没有其他文字", "命令行为空", "text:输入shell命令"],
    ["提示符后面有echo命令",   "命令行已有内容", "ctrl:按回车执行"],
], tmpdir)

# Cmd expert: hint → real command
cmd_experience = make_tensor([
    ["text:输入shell命令\n任务是列出目录",    "需要ls",   "ls"],
    ["text:输入shell命令\n任务是输出hello",   "需要echo", "echo hello world"],
    ["ctrl:按回车执行",                       "按Enter",  "Enter"],
], tmpdir)
```

These are `[N, 3]` QKV tensors — trainable via backward + `StSGD`. More experience = better generalization.

### Portable Modules

A harness Module is defined by:
1. **Experience tensors** — the learned skill (trainable via autograd)
2. **Validator** — the termination condition (harness-specific)
3. **Pipeline structure** — identical across all modules (shared ops)

Same structure + different experience = different behavior:

| Module | Experience 1 | Experience 2 | Validator |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Coder | terminal → action_type | hint → shell cmd | prompt returns to idle |
| Debugger | error → strategy | strategy → debug cmd | tests pass |
| Deployer | status → action | action → deploy cmd | service healthy |

```bash
python -m experience.future_tensor.test.test_llm_coder_simulator
```

## Why a Compute Graph?

Programs are sequential, branch, and loop. We compact all three into typed tensor ops:

| Control flow | Op | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Sequential | `ft_sequential` | Do A then B |
| Branch | `ft_switch` | If X then A else B |
| Loop | `ft_recurrent` | Repeat until validator passes |

This makes agent generation trivial for LLMs. Instead of writing correct imperative code (hard — shared state, error handling, async coordination), the LLM composes a graph from ~10 typed ops (easy — slot-filling with shape verification). Three properties make this uniquely LLM-friendly:

1. **Structure vs behavior separation.** The LLM generates the graph (structure) once. Behavior is determined by experience tensors, which self-improve through training. The LLM doesn't need to get behavior right at generation time.
2. **Shape contracts = static verification.** If shapes don't match, the composition is wrong — detectable before execution. LLMs make fewer structural errors than behavioral errors.
3. **Fault-tolerant generation.** Even poor seed experience gets corrected by training. The graph just needs to be structurally correct.

## How It Works

### Tensor Elements Are Files

Each tensor element is a text file on disk. Numeric coefficients flow through standard PyTorch autograd while symbolic content (code, translations, commands) lives in files.

```
{relative_to}/{tensor_uid}/
├── shape                    # JSON: [2, 3]
├── storage/
│   ├── 0/data               # Element at flat index 0
│   ├── 1/data               # Element at flat index 1
│   └── 1/1/data             # Multi-digit index 11
```

### ExperienceTensor

An `[N, 3]` tensor where each row is `(query, key, value)`:
- **Query**: semantic keywords for Jaccard similarity retrieval
- **Key**: source domain content
- **Value**: target domain content

Starts empty, populated during training. The backward pass computes diffs, the optimizer patches entries.

### FutureTensor (Lazy Async Ops)

A `FutureTensor` is a scalar `torch.Tensor` monkey-patched with `ft_*` attributes — a reference to a pending computation. Elements materialize on-demand via LLM calls.

| Op | Purpose |
|----|---------|
| `ft_expert` | Query + retrieval + LLM translation (chainable) |
| `ft_switch` | Lazy control-flow branch selection |
| `ft_sequential` | Sequential evaluation with early-return on error |
| `ft_recurrent` | Generate-validate retry loop (reduces last dim) |
| `ft_tmux_*` | Terminal session ops (create, send_text, send_ctrl, capture) |
| `ft_slice` / `ft_unsqueeze` | Shape manipulation with autograd |

### Dual-Channel Gradients

| Channel | Carries | Computed by |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Numeric** | Float coefficients (bfloat16) | Standard autograd |
| **Symbolic** | Unified diffs in files | LLM compares actual vs expected |

Optimizer (`StSGD`) applies both: numeric SGD update + `patch` CLI applies diffs to experience files.

### Second Derivative (Meta-Learning)

The LLM reflects on its own reflections:

```python
backward_dispatch_start = torch.ones((), dtype=torch.bfloat16, requires_grad=True)
anchored = need_reflection(input_ft, backward_dispatch_start)
output = model(anchored)
loss = ft_mean(output)

loss.backward(create_graph=True)

records = []
with dispatch_policy(TracePolicy(records)):
    backward_dispatch_start.grad.backward()
# records: list of ReflectionRecord(fn, inputs, output, timestamp)
```

## Design Principles

- **Static DAG, not imperative orchestration** — compose a graph of lazy tensors, then pull from output
- **Chain experts, don't parse** — two chained `ft_expert` ops replace custom parsers
- **No shared mutable state** — coordination through tensor coordinates
- **Observe the world directly** — read live state, no shadow copies
- **Self-improving** — experience accumulates knowledge via backward + optimizer step
- **Experience starts empty** — learned entirely at runtime, cold-start supported
- **LLM as compute kernel** — replaces matrix multiplication with semantic reasoning

## Roadmap

0. **Stage 0: Tmux-forced coding agent capture (immediate).** Hook Claude Code (via MCP or shell wrapper) to route all bash commands through tmux sessions. Capture every terminal interaction as `(observation, decision, command)` triples. Write them directly into experience tensors for harness model cold start. No harness model needed — pure data harvesting from real coding sessions.
1. **Adapter mechanism for existing coding agents.** Two directions:
   - **Agent → Harness Module**: wrap Claude Code / OpenCode / OpenClaw / Hermes as a Harness Module — their tool interfaces become `ft_*` ops in the compute graph, gaining autograd and self-improvement for free.
   - **Harness Module → Agent skill**: export a trained Harness Module as a coding agent tool/skill — any agent can invoke it as a composable capability without knowing the internals.
2. **Ground-truth terminal interactions sharing.** Two mechanisms:
   - **Capture streams hub**: record live terminal sessions into standardized experience tensors via tmux capture. A central hub aggregates streams from multiple developers/agents into a shared experience pool.
   - **Learn from existing interactions**: train harness agents on recorded ground-truth sessions — enabling experience transfer across agents. One agent's successful terminal interaction becomes another agent's seed experience.
3. **Meta tasks learning.** For each new code repo, bootstrap experience through self-supervised tasks that require no human labels:
   - **Masked code reconstruction**: mask a code region, train the agent to reconstruct it from surrounding context. Teaches code structure and local patterns.
   - **Docstring ↔ code**: given a docstring, generate the implementation (and vice versa). Teaches intent-to-code mapping.
   - **Code coverage by tests**: given a function, generate tests that maximize coverage. Teaches behavioral understanding.
   - **Runtime stack prediction**: given a call site, predict the runtime call stack. Teaches control flow and dependency reasoning.

## Suggested Study: Progressive Research

Five stages of increasing autonomy — each stage removes one human-in-the-loop dependency:

| Stage | Forward | Experience Update | Graph Update |
|-------|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| 0 | Claude Code in tmux | captured terminal sessions → experience | manual graph |
| 1 | 0th reflection | coding agent directly | coding agent directly |
| 2 | 0th reflection | 1st reflection (autograd) | coding agent guided by 2nd reflection trace |
| 3 | 0th reflection | 1st reflection (autograd) | bootstrapped harness model guided by 2nd reflection trace |
| 4 | self-referencing harness | self-referencing harness | self-referencing harness (fixed point) |

**Stage 0: Ground-truth capture for cold start.** Force Claude Code (or any coding agent) to run all bash commands through tmux sessions instead of direct shell execution. Capture the full terminal output stream — every command typed, every response observed, every decision made. These captured sessions become ground-truth experience entries for harness model cold start: terminal observation → decision → command triples, written directly into experience tensors. No harness model runs yet — this stage purely harvests real-world coding interactions as training data.

**Stage 1: Manual iteration.** The harness runs forward (0th reflection). A coding agent (Claude Code, etc.) inspects results and directly edits experience tensors and the compute graph. This is the current working state — human-assisted improvement.

**Stage 2: Self-improving experience, assisted graph evolution.** Forward runs as before. The 1st derivative (backward pass) automatically updates experience via `StSGD` — no human needed for experience improvement. For graph structure changes, a coding agent reads the 2nd derivative trace (`ReflectionRecord` list) and decides which ops to add/remove/rewire.

**Stage 3: Fully autonomous.** Same as Stage 2, but the coding agent for graph updates is itself a trained harness model — a "meta-harness" whose experience is "how to improve compute graphs given 2nd derivative traces." The system bootstraps its own architecture search.

**Stage 4: Fixed point of recursive optimization.** Meta-harness and user-harness merge into a single self-referencing system. The meta-harness holds a complete model of itself — its own code, its own experience tensors, its own compute graph — and can introspect and modify any layer of the stack. When something unexpected happens, the system first examines the user-harness (is the experience wrong? is the graph structure suboptimal?), then examines itself (is the meta-experience wrong? is the introspection strategy flawed?). This recursive self-examination converges to a fixed point: a configuration where the system's model of itself is consistent with its actual behavior, and its optimization of itself produces no further improvement.

This is functional self-awareness. Not a philosophical claim about consciousness — a concrete engineering property. The system maintains an accurate self-model, detects discrepancies between expected and actual behavior at every level (including the level that detects discrepancies), and repairs them autonomously. The value is profound: once the optimization process can optimize itself, improvement is no longer bounded by the designer's foresight. The system discovers better learning algorithms, better introspection strategies, better experience representations — capabilities its creators never explicitly programmed. Every other self-improving system hits a ceiling where the improvement mechanism itself becomes the bottleneck. Stage 4 removes that ceiling by making the improvement mechanism part of what gets improved.

**Why self-reference works here (and why it usually doesn't).** Naive LLM self-reference — "explain why you failed" — is unreliable. LLMs confabulate. But this architecture's self-reference is grounded: the self-model is external (code and experience tensors on disk, not hidden weights), the feedback is measured (loss, test results, terminal output — not self-assessment), and modifications are testable (change experience → re-run forward → did loss decrease?). The LLM proposes candidate improvements; the framework measures whether they helped. No trust in unverified self-claims. The one constraint: the loss function and verification logic must remain grounded in external reality. A system that rewrites its own success criteria is self-deluding, not self-improving.

**Current status:** Stage 0 ready (tmux capture infrastructure works), Stage 1 implementing — forward pass, experience tensors, compute graph composition, speculative multi-action dispatch, and 2nd derivative trace recording all work. Experience update and graph update still require coding agent. Stage 2, 3, 4 are TODO.

## Thesis

Base LLM weights carry two things: **general capabilities** (reasoning, reflection) and **memories** (facts, patterns, code idioms). Most of the parameters are memories.

This project externalizes memory into trainable experience tensors — retrievable, patchable, shareable, and composable. The base LLM only needs to be good at reasoning and reflection. Everything else lives in experience.

If Stage 3's self-referencing succeeds — a harness model improving its own compute graph via 2nd derivative traces — the system becomes an open-ended self-improver. Stage 4 takes this further: when the self-improver can improve its own self-improvement process, optimization converges to a fixed point where no meta-level change yields further gain. At that point the system possesses functional self-awareness — an accurate, actionable model of itself at every level of the stack. Reasoning reflects on reasoning, experience accumulates without bound, and architecture evolves autonomously. That's the path.

## Internals

Two LLM backends: `raw_llm_api` (OpenAI-compatible, lightweight) and `coding_agent` (Claude Agent SDK with file tools), dispatched concurrently via `asyncio.gather`. Autograd functions in `symbolic_tensor/function/` implement `StMoe` (query → retrieval → LLM translate), attention, slicing (symlink views vs copies), stack, fork, merge, and edit-distance loss. Tensor utilities (`tensor_util/`) provide `make_tensor`, `get_diff_tensor`, `patch_tensor` (unified diffs, cold-start support), and Pythonic methods registered on `torch.Tensor` (`st_pack`, `st_patch`, `st_get_diff`, `st_view_slicer[...]`, etc.).
